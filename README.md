> We are Microverse students doing the first project. We created a basic HTML Structure based on the famous video player platform Youtube.

We created a header with a navbar with a search-bar. There is also a main video about how to embed videos in HTML which was very helpful and we also added a sidebar with a list of recommended videos. There is also a description section about the video as well as a comment section.

## Built With
